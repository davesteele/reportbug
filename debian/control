Description: reports bugs in the Debian distribution
 reportbug is a tool designed to make the reporting of bugs in Debian
 and derived distributions relatively painless.  Its features include:
 .
  * Integration with mutt and mh/nmh mail readers.
  * Access to outstanding bug reports to make it easier to identify
    whether problems have already been reported.
  * Automatic checking for newer versions of packages.
  * Optional automatic verification of integrity of packages via debsums.
  * Support for following-up on outstanding reports.
  * Optional PGP/GnuPG integration.
 .
 reportbug is designed to be used on systems with an installed mail
 transport agent, like exim or sendmail; however, you can edit the
 configuration file and send reports using any available mail server.

 This package also includes the "querybts" script for browsing the
 Debian bug tracking system.
